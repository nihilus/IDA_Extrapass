
IDA ExtraPass plugin
=========================================================
An IDA Pro Win32 target clean up plug-in by Sirmabus.
Version 3.5

--= Introduction =--
IDA Pro is an amazing reverse engineering and analysis tool but it
could use a little help on most medium to large executable targets.
In particular on heavy C++ OOP with many disjointed functions, ones containing
embedded script systems with many small script bind stubs et al.
This plug-in does an "extra pass" to help fix and cleanup the IDB.
It can find tens of thousands missing functions and alignment blocks making
your IDB more complete and easier to reverse.

It does essentially four processing steps:
1. Convert stray code section values to "unknown".
2. Fix missing "align" blocks.
3. Fix missing code bytes.
4. Locate and fix missing/undefined functions.

It's intended for, and only tested on typical MSVC and Intel complied Windows
32bit binary executables but it might still be helpful on Delphi/Borland(r)
and other complied targets.
Developed and tested for IDA Pro 6.5.

--= Installation =--
Copy the plug-in to your IDA Pro "plugins" directory.
Edit your "plugins.cfg' with a hotkey to run it as you would install any other
plug-in. Default hot key "ALT-1".
See IDA documentation for more on installing plug-ins.

--= Running it =--
1. Save, and, or make a backup of your IDB first.

2. Invoke the plug-in.
   Here you will have a choice of which process steps to run.
   Normally you want them all checked, but if for example you are working on a
   Delphi target then you might want to just use the last two to fix only
   missing alignment blocks and functions.

   By default the plug-in will look for the first ".text" code segment.
   To manually select, click on the "Choose code segments" button.
   Here you can do the standard CTRL, and SHIFT clicks to select multiple lines.
   For the IDA QT It's a little different. Here select the segments you want then
   right click on the list and choose the the "Select" option, then "Okay" to finish.
   In the output window you will see "Segment(s) selected:" followed by the segment
   name(s) that you selected.

3. Let it run and do it's process steps.
   It might take a while for large targets..

Once completed if all goes well, there will be a number a positive "Found-
functions:" (a before and after function count), and a lot less gray spots
on your IDA's navigator scale bar!

For best results, run the plug-in at least two times.
On a particular rough 11mb executable 13,000 missing functions were recovered
on the first run, then 1000 on the 2nd, and 900 on the third!


--= Changes =--
3.5 - Dec 30, 2015    - Updated to IDA 6.9.

3.3 - Dec 9, 2014    - Updated to IDA 6.5 or greater.

3.2 - Jan, 19, 2013  - 1) Fixed broken and, or, updated some custom UI elements.
                       2) Fixed the multi-segment select feature for the non-QT version and
                          added a working setup for the QT version too. For QT, after desired
                          segments are selected right click on the list and do "Select"
                          followed by the "Okay" button.

3.1 - Dec, 18, 2011  - Added a "fix bad function blocks" option that will many
                       tail blocks incorrectly placed as function head/start block.

3.0 - Mar, 27, 2011  - Major performance increase, now exponentially faster.
                       Replaced string search and process functions with binary
                       and value flag equivalents.
                       Added a custom code selection dialog to allow user to select
                       code segment(s).
                       Improvements to function analysis.

2.2 - Jan, 4, 2009   - Removed the position jumps. It was nice for showing progress,
                       but it does slow things down.
                       Now using a fancy customized wait dialog in it's place anyhow.
                       Added "done" audio feed back.
                       Now built with SDK 5.3,. A few small fixes and clean ups.

2.1 - Jan, 18, 2008  - Fixed an obvious issue in the missing function detection.
                       Works much better now finding a lot more functions.
                       When a problem function is found, it's start address is output
                       to the log window for the user to click on and inspect and fix.
                       Added the IDA wait dialog.

2.0 - Nov, 25, 2007  - Put in the passes for alignment blocks and finding missing
                       functions.
                       Put a wrapper around "jump" to fix an occasional crash.
                       Converted to VS2005 and added some speed optimizations.
                       Added UI to allow selection of what steps to do.

1.1 - Aug, 28, 20007 - Put WORD scanning back in, and now only attempts
                       to restore code only in the final (byte) pass.
                       This ends up  with more code recovered and makes the
                       whole process faster.
